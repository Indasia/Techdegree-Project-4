# Techdegree-Project-4

A game similar to Hangman. This game uses Object Oriented JavaScript to build a game. In this game a phrase is randomly generated and
will be displayed on the screen. The letters will be hidden until the user guesses the correct letters that are being hidden in the 
game. Once all correct letters are guessed the user wins, if they lose all their "lives" they lose the game.


Understand the rules of the game:
- The playerâ€™s goal is to guess all the letters in a hidden, random phrase. At the beginning, 
the player only sees the number of letters and words in the phrase, represented by blank boxes on the screen.
- The player clicks the keyboard or onscreen keyboard to guess letters in the phrase.
- The letter is disabled on the onscreen keyboard and a player can't select that letter again.
- If the selected letter is in the phrase at least once, the letter and its position in the phrase is highlighted on screen. 
All instances of the letter are made visible (so if there are 3 A's, all of the A's in the phrase appear at once).
-If the selected letter is not in the phrase, one of the player's hearts in the scoreboard is changed from a "live" heart 
to a "lost" heart.
- The player keeps choosing letters until they reveal all the letters in the phrase, or they make five incorrect guesses.
